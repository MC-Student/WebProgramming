# WebProgramming
Coursework/one final project for Web Programming class.
Independent PHP-based website project created throughout web programming course. Uses HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySqli/SQL through PHPMyAdmin.
DISCLAIMER: not a complete or functional website (and requires much more secure practices), but fulfilled all project requirements (and more)!
This was my first time coding in PHP, using databases, and using XAMPP!
